    <h3>Stations as base-units</h3>
    <p>
        Stickmaps is build around the concept of "survey stations" where a "line" is just the connection between two stations.
        It is important to remember this when converting from one program to another as others might use lines as their base unit.
    </p>
    <h3>Order of measurements</h3>
    <p>
        Keeping things clear and making things easy are two different things, in Stickmaps we chose to keep things clear while making them as simple as possible.
        The most important thing to remember is "Stations are our base-unit", and from there we measure.
    </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Length in</dt>
            <dd>We measure the length from the previous station to the current one.</dd>
            <dt>Azimuth in</dt>
            <dd>We measure azimuth from the previous station to the current one.</dd>
            <dt>Depth</dt>
            <dd>We measure depth of the current station.</dd>
            <dt>Azimuth out</dt>
            <dd>We measure the azimuth from the current station to the next station</dd>
            <dt>Length out</dt>
            <dd>We measure the length from the current station to the next station</dd>
        </dl>
    
    <h3>We use Drag&Drop</h3>
    <p>
        We have chosen for a visual approach when it comes to the user interface.
        For instance; importing lines to your maps should be a visual experience, just as removing a line should not require you to select stations in a grid-view.
        As a result of this, some elements in our interface are done by Drag&Drop, there will be no button in order to do so.
    </p>
    <h3>SQL enabled</h3>
    <p>
        We have chosen to use SQL as a database backend, this enables you as a user to break in to the internal data-structure.
        If you know (or a re willing to learn) SQL, you can manualy retrieve and/or modify every single piece of data that flows through the application from within any SQL-client of your choice.
    </p>
    <h3>We import anything</h3>
    <p>
        We are constantly looking to improve on our importing features!
        If you have a device that you would like to see supported, a specific file format that you would like to be able to open.
        Let us know!
