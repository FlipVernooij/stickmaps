√ = Square root = math.sqrt(), math.sqrt(9) = 3
        How many height/width units would a square have when the total units would be x
        
                    1 2 3
                    2    
                    3
                    
3² = 3 to the power of 2 = math.pow(3, 2) =  3*3 = 9
3⁴ = 3 to the power of 4 = math.pow(3m4) = 3*3*3*3 = 81

log ₂(8) = 3  = math.log(8,2) = log is the opisite of pow.
        Example: How many 2s do we multiply to get 8?
        Answer: 2 × 2 × 2 = 8, so we had to multiply 3 of the 2s to get 8
